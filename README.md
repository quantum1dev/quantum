<b>Introduction </b>

Quantum is P2P cloud data management platform that delivers data protection, search, analytics, compliance, and copy data management to hybrid cloud enterprises through blockchain technology .
It is a distributed database on steroids: a self-verifying sequential storage scheme that can be used to immutably record transactions, ownership or identity, to negotiate and enforce contracts, and much more besides.

The word quantum comes from the Lation word Quantus which means a discrete quantity of energy .

<b>Development process</b>

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.
The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see doc/coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Quantum .

<b>Testing</b>

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.
